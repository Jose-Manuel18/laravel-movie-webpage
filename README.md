## Laravel Movie Web Page

This project is a movie website built with Laravel, utilizing Livewire and Jetstream for enhanced functionality and user interaction. It's a space where users can explore popular movies and watch their trailers.

Laravel, a comprehensive PHP framework, forms the backbone of the project, facilitating robust and secure backend operations. Livewire helps in creating dynamic front-end components, reducing dependency on JavaScript. Jetstream adds valuable features like authentication, email verification, and session management, saving time on building these from scratch.

The website has a responsive design, thanks to Tailwind CSS, ensuring an optimal user experience regardless of the device they're using. Tailwind's utility-first approach greatly aids in creating a visually appealing, custom, and mobile-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

First, run these commands in this exact same order:

```bash
composer update
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
npm install      
npm run build
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

And in order to see the movies you'll need to add your TMDB_API_KEY in .env file
